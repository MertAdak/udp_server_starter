## How To Use?
Clone the project to your computer by typing: $ git clone https://github.com/MertAdak/udp_server_starter.git

Don't forget to clone the client_starter of the project in order to communicate between two terminals or two computers.
You can clone the client_starter by typing: $ git clone https://github.com/MertAdak/udp_client_starter.git

1) Now open two terminals and go to the project directories
      Terminal 1: $ cd Desktop/udp_server_starter
      Terminal 2: $ cd Desktop/udp_client_starter
                   
2) In both terminals type: $make

3) In the terminal which is in the server_starter, start the server by typing: $./udp_server

4) In the terminal which is in the client_starter, start the server by typing: $./udp_client

Now you sent the existing message lies in the udp_client.cpp to the server! You can edit ip and port by just changing the values in starter.config file.
